# EdgeCloudFatTreeILP

- This repo contains model file and data file for IBM CPLEX to solve edge-cloud model with Fat-tree topology involved in Datacenter
- Problem: Mapping SFC to Edge-Cloud topology with the goal is maximizing number of accepted SFC
- The problem is modelled as Interger Linear Programming

# Fat tree ILP

- The Fat tree ILP model can be achieved by simply removing all the edge component of the mod file, most constraints are reserved.
- The current data file was initiated with k = 10, 300 edge devices, SFC with 4 VNFs
